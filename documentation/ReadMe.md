# ParseDemo 2024 Version

## Completed 

* Removed depricated code and replaced it with modern versions


* Made the screen size adjustible and adaptable for all screen sizes


* Fixed bug causing SR Parser to crash




## Incomplete Work
 
B-Minor has not been completely intergrated, the scanner &  grammar have been added but work still needs to be done to connect the scanner and grammar to the front end and to create the table and tree.
